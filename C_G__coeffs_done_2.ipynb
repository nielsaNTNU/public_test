    "## Motivation for Computing the Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients\n",
    "The motivation for computing Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is mainly that they answer the question: *If I pair two angular momentum states, how does the new angular momentum state relate to the original, individual states?* The emergent two-particle state can be written as a linear combination (superposition) of states, and we are interested in the coefficients of this linear combination. These coefficients are known as the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "For concreteness, the term angular momentum states can be thought of as states describing particles with angular momentum. The angular momentum can be either orbital momentum, or the intrinsic orbital momentum (spin), carried by most elementary particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CG coefficients are computable by hand, normally through the use of ladder operators, but the computation quickly becomes time consuming as the total angular momentum increases. Thus, it is more common to look them up in a table or calculate them numerically. In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to do the latter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Online tables of CG coefficients are for example the Wikipedia.org web page [[1]](#rsc) or Particle Data Group's [[2]](#rsc). We will use these tables to verify our results."

    "## Addition of angular momenta and the CG Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not cover the details of addition of angular momentum in this notebook. We recommend [[3]](#rsc) (English) or [[4]](#rsc) (Norwegian) for a gentle introduction on the subject. However, we will cover the most basic properties needed to understand the CG coefficients. The total angular momentum vector of a particle, $\\textbf{J}$, can be written as the vector sum $\\textbf{J} = \\textbf{L} + \\textbf{S}$, where $\\textbf{L}$ denotes the orbital angular momentum  and $\\textbf{S}$ denotes the intrinsic angular momentum. One can furthermore add the total angular momentum vectors of two particles $\\textbf{J}_{1} + \\textbf{J}_{2} = \\textbf{J}$. This restricts the possible values for the total angular momentum for the new state. In particular, this enforces the quantum number $j$ (corresponding to $\\textbf{J}$), to take the values $|j_{1} - j_{2}| \\leq j \\leq j_{1} + j_{2}$, with unit integer increments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we define the CG coefficients, we need to make a short detour and introduce the total angular momentum projection quantum number $m$. It is instructive to first consider a single particle with orbital momentum $l_1$, spin $s_1$, and thus $j_1 \\in \\{|l_1 - s_1|, |l_1 - s_1| + 1, ..., l_1 + s_1\\}$. The possible values for the magnetic quantum number $m_1$ is then given by $m_1 \\in \\{ -j_1, -j_1 + 1, ..., j_1 - 1, j_1 \\}$. Physically, one measures $m_1$ by projecting the angular momentum on a certain axis, conventionally along the $z$-axis. These relations also hold for the two-particle example described above, such that for each possible $j$, we have a corresponding set of $m$-s given by $m\\in \\{ -j, -j + 1, ..., j - 1, j \\}$. $m$ must also fulfill  $m = m_{1} + m_{2}$. Note that quantum numbers with subscripts refer to a specific particle, whereas the quantum numbers without subscripts denote the new two-particle state. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to write the expression for the CG-coefficients. In bra-ket notation the equation relating the two-particle state $|j m \\rangle$ in terms of the initial angular momentum states, $| j_{1} m_{1} \\rangle | j_{2} m_{2} \\rangle$, is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "| j m \\rangle = \\sum_{m_{1},m_{2}}\\langle j_{1} m_1 j_{2}m_{2} | j m \\rangle  | j_{1} m_{1} \\rangle | j_{2} m_{2} \\rangle,\n",
    "\\label{CG_def}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the CG-coefficients are defined as the real valued coefficient $\\langle j_{1}m_{1}j_{2}m_{2} | j m \\rangle$. From equation \\eqref{CG_def}, the physical interpretation of the CG coefficients reemerges; They describe how much of each old state is contained in the new states. It is thus immediately clear that the square of the CG coefficients represent probability amplitudes. "

    "### Example: Addition of Angular Momentum of Two Electrons\n",

    "Consider adding the angular momentum of two electrons with $l_{1} = l_{2} = 0$ and $s_{1} = s_{2} = 1/2$. Physically, these are electrons described by $s$-orbitals. We then have $j_{1} = j_{2} = 1/2$, and hence $m_{1},m_{2} \\in \\{-1/2, 1/2\\}$. Thus, the total angular momentum for the new two-particle state, $j$, fulfills $0 \\leq j \\leq 1$. And since $j$ increases in integer steps, $j \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n",

    "In the following, we again refer to [[3]](#rsc) and [[4]](#rsc) for a detailed derivation for the the two-particles states, here we will focus on the results. Using kets to denote quantum numbers, we have a singlet normalized product state with $j = 0$ by the combination\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have made a program which allows us to calculate the CG coefficients for any pair of $j_1$ and $j_2$. With the functionality presented here, a generalization to systems of more than two particles is straightforward (see that you understand why!). For larger quantum numbers, an automated routine will save us a great deal of time when calculating the CG coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth noting the physical significance of these states. For fermions, we know that the total wave function for a system of fermions should be anti-symmetric with respect to interchanging coordinates (both spin and spatial) of two identical particles. Thus, if the spin part of the wave function is described by the singlet in equation \\eqref{singlet}, it is clear that an interchange in the spin coordinates would pick up a minus sign, and hence the spatial part of wave function must be symmetric with respect to interchange. The reverse is true for triplets, requiring triplets to have an anti-symmetric spatial wave function. This kind of symmetry often has profound consequences in physics, with examples from e.g. particle physics or condensed matter physics. In other words, what we have studied in this notebook has important, real-world implications!"
